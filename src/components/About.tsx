          <h2>âœ¨ What I do</h2>
          <p>
          I design and build backend systems that scale â€” with care, clarity, and a bias for action. I love to turn ideas into products, whether thatâ€™s launching financing platforms, or integrating AI tools into existing workflows.

          <h2>ðŸ’¡ What I care about</h2>
          <p>
          I care about building things that last â€” not just in uptime, but in impact. Tools that help people do what they do better. Products that feel thoughtful. Code thatâ€™s easy to pick up long after itâ€™s been written.
<p>Iâ€™m driven by a quiet principle from Japanese aesthetics: <b>mono no aware</b> â€” which means the gentle awareness of impermanence. It reminds me to appreciate every fleeting build cycle, every team moment, every shipped line of code. Nothing lasts forever, so letâ€™s make it count while itâ€™s here.</p>


I care about clarity, craft, and leaving systems â€” and people â€” better than I found them.
