          <h2>âœ¨ What I do</h2>
          <p>
          I build backend systems designed to handle scale without breaking. I care about the details, write code thatâ€™s easy to follow, and focus on steady progress. I like taking ideas from whiteboard sketches to production.

          <h2>ðŸ’¡ What I care about</h2>
          <p>
          I want to build things that stick around, not just servers with good uptime but products that actually matter to people. Tools that make work better. Software that feels like someone thought about the humans using it. Code that makes sense six months later when someone else needs to work with it.
          </p>
          <p>There's this Japanese concept I really connect with: <b>mono no aware</b>â€”the bittersweet awareness that nothing lasts forever. It reminds me that every build cycle, every team collaboration, every deployment is temporary. That's why I try to make each one count.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, I just want to leave both code and teams better than I found them.</p>

            <li>Can't stop tinkering with new tech. My GitHub is basically a graveyard of weekend projects that taught me something cool.</li>
